This is a fun project. I have always been impressed with iOS's UI gestures & animations. Previously I developed [React Native Hold Menu](https://github.com/enesozturk/react-native-hold-menu) which I inspired by the iOS messages, applications hold to open menus. This time, I tried to do the whole iOS itself for fun, and the result is awesome!

## Stack

- [Expo](https://expo.dev/) (SDK 44)
- TypeScript
- [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/)
- [React Native Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/)
- [Expo Blur](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-blur) for animatable blur component

## Want to try?

If you want to try this on your device, you can install and run the app in a few seconds with the following commands;

Install the packages:

```
yarn install
```

Start the server

```bash
yarn start
```

You will see a QR code on the terminal, you can scan this QR code with the device which you are on the same network. Or you can start the simulator by pressing `i`, on the terminal.

> Currently app is not working the same with iOS on Android due to some issues with blur view animations and horizontal gesture animations. I may fix it later.

That's it, enjoy 🤞🏽
